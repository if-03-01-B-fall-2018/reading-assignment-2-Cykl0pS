        <h2>HTML:</h2></p>
            HTML ELEMENTS: The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.
            h1, p, br..... etc. DO NOT FORGET THE END TAG!
		</br>
            HTML elements with no content are called <em>void</em> elements!
        </br>

            br is an void element without a closing tag!
        </br>

            Void elements can be "closed" in the opening tag like this: br/.
        </br>
            All HTML elements can have attributes
        </br>
            Attributes provide additional information about an element
        </br>
            Attributes are always specified in the start tag
        </br>
            Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
        </br>
            HTML images are defined with the img tag.
        </br>
            The filename of the image source is specified in the src attribute:
        </br>
            img src="img_girl.jpg"
        </br>
            The alt attribute specifies an alternative text to be used, when an image cannot be displayed.
            img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket"
        </br>
			HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not need a DTD declaration.
        </br>
            Headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags.
        </br>
            h1 defines the most important heading. h6 defines the least important heading.
        </br>
            The article tag specifies independent, self-contained content.
        </br>
            The body tag defines the document's body.
        </br>
            The br tag inserts a single line break.
        </br>
            The br tag is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag.
        </br>
            The head element is a container for all the head elements.
        </br>
            The html tag tells the browser that this is an HTML document.
        </br>
            The img tag defines an image in an HTML page.
        </br>
            The img tag has two required attributes: src and alt.
        </br>
            The p tag defines a paragraph.
        </br>
            The title tag is required in all HTML documents and it defines the title of the document.
        </br>
            The section tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document.
        </br>
            The a tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
        </br>
            The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code. Comments are not displayed in the browsers.
        </br>
            it is used like so <.!-- -->.
        </br>
            Metadata is data (information) about data!</p>
